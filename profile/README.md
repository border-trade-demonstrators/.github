# Border Trade Demonstrators

The [dashboard](https://github.com/border-trade-demonstrators/dashboard) lists the existing Border Trade Demonstrators (BTDs), Ecosystem of Trust (EoT) instances and BTD roadmap. This repository is private/closed and you will need an invitation.

## About

Border Trade Demonstrators (BTDs) will deliver on the recommendations made in the [EoT Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023) (and any ongoing research and learning). They represent a collaborative approach with the Cabinet Office Border Innovation Team coordinating activity with Government, the Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation, industry, trade experts, standards bodies and other jurisdictions.

BTDs replace transient pilots which in many cases are shelved after the event with a more enduring way to let Government and private sector experiment with real world trade machinery (e.g. EoTs and reliable systems). Any combination of Government and industry actors (including supply chain actors) can coordinate research and interoperability initiatives to innovate towards meeting their business, operational and policy objectives. This will improve collaboration, decrease the load on all involved and create a better shared understanding of border and trade related problems.

BTDs do not disrupt border processes, they add new options and capabilities (built on existing EoT building blocks, ETD reliable systems machinery and paperless trade initiatives and existing data flows) to improve the efficiency and efficacy of these processes. Trialling and adopting these demonstrators is optional.

BTDs will co-design, implement, operationalise and evaluate key use cases which are either already defined in the EoT report or which ecosystem participants (and potential participants) will submit in the form of proposals. There will be a documented proposal submission process (TBD).

It is possible for a number of BTDs to be plugged into a given EoT instance and for a single BTD to be plugged into a number of EoT instances.

When a BTD is evaluated successfully it is promoted to be a capability which by default can be plugged into any EoT instance or reliable system upon consideration.

## Principles

1. Real data will be made operationally usable wherever possible and sensible
2. Border trade demonstrators will be enduring where possible and sensible and will not be switched off (where there are no dual-running or operational concerns)
3. Successful BTDs will be open for inclusion into any EoT and Reliable System deployment
4. Where relevant BTDs will test governance and information governance machinery not only data and technology

## Themes and topics for BTDs

BTDs exist and will continue to be proposed to address a number of themes and topics including:

- the ability for government agencies, other jurisidictions and border systems to pick out selected data fields from commercial systems
- the ability for government agencies to share real-time risking insights via notifications generated through operational processes
- the ability for industry and other jurisdictions to receive information from the government
- the ability to spot other barriers to data visibility
- a move towards paperless trade
- automation of the creation of key trade documents through the application of 'recommender' systems
- automated documentation and trade data consistency checks
